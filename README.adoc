[id='jboss-parent-pom']
= JBoss Parent POM

The parent Maven POM for JBoss community projects.

Central]]

[id='what-is-it']
== What is it?

The JBoss parent POM provides default configuration for Maven builds.

* Recommended/Default versions for the most commonly used Maven plugins
* Manifest configuration for the jar and assembly plugins
* Profiles for generating source jars, and enforcing a minimum versions
of Java and Maven
* Distribution Management and other configuration for deploying to the
JBoss.org Maven repositories

[id='how-to-use-it']
== How to use it?

Start out by adding the parent configuration to your pom.

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
  <groupId>org.jboss</groupId>
  <artifactId>jboss-parent</artifactId>
  <version>40</version>
  <!-- The empty relativePath makes Maven look it up in the repository. Missing tag default is ../pom.xml. -->
  <relativePath/>
</parent>
----

The pom includes properties which allow various build configuration to
be customized. For example, to override the default version of the
`maven-compiler-plugin`, just set a property.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <version.compiler.plugin>3.1</version.compiler.plugin>
</properties>
----

Or override the default Java compiler release level used in the build. This uses the `javac --release` argument to compile
for the specified Java SE release. Note the default level is 11.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <maven.compiler.release>17</maven.compiler.release>
</properties>
----

If you need tests compiled at a different level, you can use the `maven.compiler.testRelease` property. This defaults
to the `maven.compiler.release` property.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <maven.compiler.testRelease>21</maven.compiler.testRelease>
</properties>
----

NOTE: If you're compiling down to Java 1.8, you can still use the `maven.compiler.release` property. Simply set the
value to `1.8` and it the appropriate settings will be configured.

The minimum version of Java or Maven required to run a build can also be
set via properties.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <maven.min.version>3.9.0</maven.min.version>
  <jdk.min.version>17</jdk.min.version>
</properties>
----

If `jdk.min.version` is not set, it defaults to the version defined by the `maven.compiler.release` property.

For the full list of properties, refer to the POM itself.

[id='the-jboss-release-profile']
== The JBoss Release Profile

The parent POM includes a Maven profile called `jboss-release`. This
profile contains settings for generating a full project source archive,
javadoc jar files, and release deployment metadata.

It also includes configuration for automatically deploying to a Nexus 3 server.

If using the Maven
release plugin, this profile will automatically be activated during the
release:perform step.

If the Maven release plugin is not used during the release process, the
profile can be manually activated from the command line during a release
build.

To authenticate to the remote Nexus server, a username and password token is generally required.
Contact your server administrator to get this information. The correct authentication configuration is determined by the `nexus.serverId` property, which defaults to `jboss`. In your `settings.xml`, you would have a configuration like this:

.Example `settings.xml` snippet for deployment authentication
[source,xml]
----
<servers>
    <!-- ... -->
    <server>
        <id>jboss</id> <!-- this is the nexus.serverId -->
        <!-- these are base64-encoded tokens provided by your admin -->
        <username>xxxxxxxx</username>
        <password>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</password>
    </server>
</servers>
----

In addition, the release artifacts will be signed (see <<the-gpg-sign-profile>> for information on how to customize GPG signing).

The `jboss-release` profile will by default also produce an extra top-level artifact with the suffix `-source-release`.
This artifact will contain the complete contents of the source tree used to deploy the project.
This behavior may be disabled by setting the `skipReleaseAssembly` property to `true`.

.Usage example for the `jboss-release` profile
[source,bash]
----
mvn -Pjboss-release deploy
----

[id='release-profile-configuration']
=== Release profile configuration

The following properties configure aspects of the release profile behavior:

[cols="1m,1m,2",options="header"]
|===
|Property|Default|Description
|nexus.serverId|jboss|The server ID used for deployment.
|nexus.repo.url|https://repository.jboss.org/nexus|The URL of the Nexus 3 server to deploy to.
|nexus.repo.name|releases|The name of the repository to deploy to.
|skipReleaseAssembly|false|If `true`, the `-source-release` artifact will not be created.
|===

[id='staged-deployments']
=== Staged releases

By default, the `jboss-release` profile deploys artifacts to the configured Nexus 3 server using the nxrm3-maven-plugin's `deploy` goal.
The usual expectation when that goal is used is that the repository to which the artifacts are deployed will be their ultimate location,
where typical Maven clients will access them. **Typically this would mean the artifacts will be immediately publicly visible as the build using `jboss-release` runs.** For some release processes, immediate visibility may be acceptable. However, the `nxrm3-maven-plugin` also supports stage->validate->promote workflows with
its `staging-deploy`, `staging-move` and `staging-delete` goals.

The parent POM includes a Maven profile,  `jboss-staging-deploy`, and a Maven property to support use of these goals.

The following Maven property is used by all three goals:

[cols="1m,1m,2",options="header"]
|===
|Property|Default|Description
|nexus.staging.tag|empty string|Tag to associate with all deployed artifacts. An empty string results in a plugin-generated tag.
|===

**NOTE:** Nexus 3 uses the term "tag" for an arbitrary metadata string that can be associated with deployed artifacts and used for working with those artifacts as a unit. Use of "tag" in this context does not refer to the git tag concept.

A typical good practice would be to set this property in a child pom to a combination of a unique-to-the-project string and the release version:

.Usage example for the `nexus.staging.tag` property
[source,xml]
----
<nexus.staging.tag>project-foo-${project.version}</nexus.staging.tag>
----

[id='the-jboss-staging-deploy-profile']
==== The JBoss Staging Deploy Profile

To deploy to a staging repository, use the `jboss-staging-deploy` profile in combination with the `jboss-release` profile.

.Usage example for the `jboss-staging-deploy` profile
[source,bash]
----
mvn -Pjboss-release -Pjboss-staging-deploy deploy
----

All deployed artifacts will have an associated tag, with the value of the `nexus.staging.tag` Maven property, or a generated value the property is not configured.
This tag is later used to identify artifacts to move from the staging repository to their final destination, or to delete them from the staging repository.

[id='staged-artifact-promotion']
==== Staged Artifact Promotion with `nxrm3:staging-move`

Once the build that used the `jboss-staging-deploy` profile is complete, the staged artifacts can be validated. If they are acceptable, they can be moved from
the staging repository to the final repository where typical Maven clients will access them.

This move is accomplished by a `mvn` execution that executes a single nxrm3-maven-plugin goal:

.Usage example for the `nxrm3:staging-move` goal
[source,bash]
----
mvn nxrm3:staging-move
----

The following property is used by the parent POM's configuration of the `default-staging-move` Maven execution that runs when that goal is invoked:

[cols="1m,2",options="header"]
|===
|Property|Description
|nexus.destination.repo.name|The name of the repository to move the tagged artifacts to
|===

The `default-staging-move` execution also uses the `nexus.staging.tag` property described earlier to determine the tag identifying the artifacts that should be moved.

[id='staged-artifact-deletion']
==== Staged Artifact Deletion with `nxrm3:staging-delete`

If the build that used the `jboss-staging-deploy` profile did not complete successfully, or if the deployed artifacts are otherwise not suitable for promotion from the staging repo, they can be deleted from the staging repository.

This move is accomplished by a `mvn` execution that executes a single nxrm3-maven-plugin goal:

.Usage example for the `nxrm3:staging-delete` goal
[source,bash]
----
mvn nxrm3:staging-delete
----

The parent POM's configuration of the `default-staging-delete` Maven execution that runs when that goal is invoked uses the `nexus.staging.tag` property described earlier to determine the tag identifying the artifacts that should be moved.

[id='the-gpg-sign-profile']
== The GPG Sign Profile

This POM includes a Maven profile called "gpg-sign" which provides a
default configuration to generate GPG signatures for the build
artifacts.

*Note:* if the <<the-jboss-release-profile>> is used, then GPG signing is automatically enabled, and this profile does not need to be explicitly activated.

.Example Maven command line for activating GPG signing
[source,bash]
----
mvn -Pgpg-sign deploy
----

In order for the gpg plugin to properly create a signature for each
artifact, the properties `gpg.keyname` and `gpg.passphrase` may be used.
These properties can either be set in a
build profile, or on the command line.

.Example GPG key properties
[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <gpg.keyname>me@home.com</gpg.keyname>
    <!-- Don't keep passphrase in plain text! -->
    <gpg.passphrase>secret</gpg.passphrase>
</properties>
----

If no `gpg.keyname` is given, then the default GPG key will be used.
If no default GPG is configured, then the default key will be the first key found in the local secret keyring.

If no `gpg.passphrase` is given, then the GPG plugin will attempt to acquire the passphrase from a GPG agent.
If that fails, it will attempt to read the passphrase from the console.

To prevent the passphrase from being read on the console,
set the `gpg.pinEntryMode` property to `error`.

[id='mr-jars']
== Multi-Release JARs
Starting with version 30, the JBoss Parent POM provides a framework for multi-release JAR build and test.

[id='mr-jar-overview']
=== Functional overview

The multi-release JAR support works in two parts: compilation and testing.

[id='mr-jar-compilation']
==== Compilation

Compilation works by providing extra executions of the compiler plugin in order to build the additional JAR layers.  The
base layer is built by the standard `default-compile` execution.  After that, Maven profiles are activated based on the
presence of extra layer source directories (e.g. `src/main/java12`, `src/main/java16` etc.).  These profiles contain
additional executions of the compiler plugin which compile the sources in the layer directory, while putting the output
of the previous step on the class path.

Each present layer is in turn compiled with the results of all the previous layers on the classpath in the correct order.
The additional layer class files are output under the `target/classes` directory in the appropriate location for
multi-release JAR layers.

In order to select the correct class files for the given Java version, the `<release>` property is used.
This prevents accidental usage of APIs which are only present in later versions than the one
being compiled.

[id='mr-jar-testing']
==== Testing

Testing using `maven-surefire-plugin` is supported by running the project unit tests on
every supported Java version.  In order to do so, it is expected that the following system
property or properties are set as needed:

* `java11.home`: this property must be set to the location of a Java 11 JDK installation
* `java17.home`: this property must be set to the location of a Java 17 JDK installation
* `java21.home`: this property must be set to the location of a Java 21 JDK installation

In order to simplify development, it is recommended to project maintainers to set these
properties in your personal Maven `settings.xml` file.

Extra unit tests are run for a given platform whenever a newer version than that platform
was used to build the project and the appropriate control file is found (see <<build-control-files>>).

=== Configuration

To configure a multi-release JAR, you need the following pieces of information:

* The minimum (oldest) version of Java that will be supported by the project
* The maximum (newest) version of Java for which your project has sources

[id='mr-jar-base-layer']
==== Step 1: Base layer version

Choose your base layer version. This can be Java 11 or anything later. Set the `maven.compiler.release` property to
your desired version and this will configure the `maven-compiler-plugin` with the release version.

[id='mr-jar-highest-layer']
==== Step 2: Highest layer version

Configure the `jdk.min.version` property as described above to match either:

* The maximum (newest) Java version for which _sources exist_ in your project, or
* Some Java version higher than that

This is the version of Java that will build all of your layers, so it necessarily must be
able to compile every version of Java sources from oldest to newest.

[id='mr-jar-source-dirs']
==== Step 3: Source directories

The sources for your base layer continue to reside in `src/main/java` and `src/test/java`.

Additional layers are in directories whose names correspond to the version of Java that
is targeted by that directory.  For example, sources which are specific to Java 13 and later
would be in `src/main/java13`, whereas sources which are specific to Java 16 and later would
be in `src/main/java16`.

If you have a class that needs an alternative implementation for a given Java version, you only
need to provide the replacement source file in the directory corresponding to the _oldest_
version that supports the alternative source.  It is not necessary to copy identical classes into
more than one layer; doing so will increase the size of the resultant artifact needlessly.

There are restrictions on these directories.  You may only provide sources that correspond
to sources that exist in the base layer - that is, it is a violation of the MR JAR specification to provide
sources that introduce new APIs only in later Java versions.  The JDK does enforce this at run time.
In addition, providing additional public members in later versions is generally not recommended.

[id='mr-jar-gh-actions']
=== Using MR JAR functions with GitHub Actions

Using this functionality with GitHub Actions is relatively simple.  It entails adding the additional JDK
version(s) by way of a setup action, and then passing the location of each additional JDK to the build.

As an example, for a project that is built on Java 17 but must also be tested against JDK 11 your `build.yml`
might look something like this:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build using Maven

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        name: Checkout

      - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        name: Set up JDKs
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: |
            11
            17

      - name: Build
        run: mvn -B verify --file pom.xml "-Djava11.home=${{env.JAVA_HOME_11_X64}}"
----

See also link:https://github.com/actions/setup-java#readme[the README for `actions/setup-java`].

Note that this configuration causes the default `JAVA_HOME` environment to be set to JDK 17.

[id='build-control-files']
== Build control files reference

These build control files are tested only for their presence.
They do not need to have any content (i.e. they can be zero-sized).

[cols="1m,2,1",options="header"]
|===
|File name|Purpose|Reference
|build-test-java11|Run tests for Java 11 when `java11.home` is set and JDK 12 or later is used.|<<mr-jar-testing>>
|build-test-java17|Run tests for Java 17 when `java17.home` is set and JDK 18 or later is used.|<<mr-jar-testing>>
|build-test-java21|Run tests for Java 21 when `java21.home` is set and JDK 22 or later is used.|<<mr-jar-testing>>
